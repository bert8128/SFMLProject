# SFMLProject
A blank sfml project - just opens an SFML window

Requires 64-bit SFML and Visual Studio 2022.

Create a folder for your libraries if you don't already have one.  Put the name of this folder in an environment variable called THIRD_PARTY_LIBS.

Unzip a 64 bit version of SFML into that folder, and call the SMFL folder SFML.

So if your library folder was called c:\ThirdPartyLibs, and you were using SFML there would be a folder C:\ThirdPartyLibs\SFML\bin.

Now open Visual Studio and run.
